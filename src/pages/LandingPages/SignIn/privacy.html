</div>
</div>

<h2 class="has-large-font-size">5. <strong>How do you earn a Cashback Reward?</strong></h2>

<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:100%">
<p>Cashback Rewards are earned based on a Merchant accumulation system. This system works as follows:</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:100%">
<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:100%">
<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:100%">
<p>1. You have to make a certain number of purchases with each given Merchant using your Rootz account cashback, in order to accumulate the Cashback Rewards amounts necessary to reach the cap established by the respective Merchant for the unlocking of your Cashback Reimbursement (the “Merchant Cap”).<br>How will you reach the Merchant Cap? You will reach this cap after the accumulated amounts of all your Cashback Rewards earned with a specific Merchant are equal to or exceed the respective Merchant Cap.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:100%">
<p>2. After you reach the Merchant Cap, the Cashback Reimbursement is created and locked during a period of time set by the Merchant which may vary between 7-30 natural days counted as of the day in which you reached the Merchant Cap, in order to prevent the User to refund the good(s) of service(s) subject to purchase (“Merchant Blocking Period”). After the Merchant Blocking Period elapses, the Cashback Reimbursement is unlocked and credited to your Rootz Account. The Cashback Reimbursement credited in your Rootz Account will always be equal to the Merchant Cap you reached.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>3. Once the Cashback Reimbursement is credited, the Merchant specific accumulation system will be restarted. Consequently, you will need to accumulate -again- all the Cashback Rewards amounts necessary to reach the relevant Merchant Cap, in order to enable the unlocking of your second Cashback Reimbursement with that Merchant.</p>


<p><strong>Example below:</strong></p>


<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:100%">
<ul><li>Merchant X posts an offer on the Rootz App with a 3% Cashback Percentage and a 15 Euros Merchant Cap.</li><li>For each purchase you make with Merchant X you will earn 3% of the amount of said purchase as Cashback Reward</li><li>You make a first purchase with Merchant X of 19 EUR purchase; consequently you earn 3% of 19 EUR as Cashback Reward, that is 0.57 EUR.</li><li>You make a second purchase with Merchant X of 40 EUR; consequently you earn 3% of 40 EUR as Cashback Reward, that is 1.20 EUR. This 1.20 amount will be accumulated to the 0.57 you already earned with Merchant X. Now you have 1.77 EUR as earned Cashback rewards with Merchant X.</li><li>You will need to continue making purchases with Merchant X, until the amount of your earned Cashback Rewards reaches the 15 EUR Merchant Cap. In the moment you reach that cap, the 15 EUR will be “unlocked” and credited to your Rootz Account.</li></ul>
</div>
</div>

<h2 class="has-large-font-size">6. Rewards Program Rules</h2>


<p>In addition to the Rewards Program:</p>


<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:100%">
<ul><li><strong>Spanish-based Users only.</strong> The Program is available only to Users who are resident in Israel territory, and have their Rootz Account associated with an Israeli phone number. Consequently, Users who are outside of Israel are not eligible to participate in the Rewards Program.</li></ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:100%">
<ul><li><strong>Cashback Percentage and Merchant Cap. </strong> The Cashback Percentage and the Merchant Cap:<ul><li>Are determined by each Merchant, and not by Rootz.</li><li>May differ according to each Merchant.</li><li>Can vary over time as well (for example: the Cashback Percentage for a given Merchant can be equal to 3% of the transaction amount for the months of April and May, and 4% between the months of September and November).</li></ul></li></ul>
</div>
</div>


<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:100%">
<ul><li><strong>Merchant pays.</strong> The Cashback Reimbursement is paid by the Merchant to the User, and not by Rootz. The role of Rootz is limited to credit the relevant funds once the Merchant Blocking Period elapses.</li></ul>
</div>
</div>


<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:100%">
<ul><li><strong><strong>Timeframe for the credit of the Cashback Reimbursement. </strong></strong>Cashback Reimbursements will be credited to your Rootz Account once the Merchant Blocking Period has elapsed. The Merchant Blocking Period may differ according to each Merchant. This means that the Cashback Reimbursements will be credited to your Rootz Account in different periods, depending on each Merchant: for some Merchants, the Cashback Reimbursement will be credited within 7-14 days counted as of the day in which you reached the Merchant Cap, while for some other Merchants the crediting of the Cashback Reimbursements to your Rootz Account may take longer ( up to 40 calendar days).</li></ul>
</div>
</div>


<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:100%">

<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:100%">
<ul><li><strong>Merchant Channels.</strong> In order to be subject for cashback eligibility, all User purchases (i.e. Qualifying Transactions) must always take place in the Merchant Channels, and not through the Rootz App.</li></ul>
</div>
</div>


<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:100%">
<ul><li><strong>Cashback Percentage limit.</strong> If, on a given Qualifying Transaction, the Cashback Award amount exceeds the Merchant Cap, the User will be credited to his/her Rootz Account the corresponding Cashback Reimbursement which shall be equal to the Merchant Cap. The portion exceeding said reimbursement will be credited as Cashback Reward earned for the following accumulation system with the relevant Merchant.</li></ul>
</div>
</div>


<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:100%">
<ul><li><strong>For example:</strong><ul><li>Merchant X establishes a 3% Merchant Percentage and an 8 EUR cap.</li><li>Your first purchase with Merchant X amounts to 300 EUR.</li><li>The 3% of 300 EUR is 9 EUR; therefore you exceeded the Merchant Cap in one (1) EUR.</li><li>Consequently, the first 8 EUR will be unlocked and credited to your Rootz Account, and the remaining one (1) EUR will be accumulated with the Cashback Reward Amount resulting from your following purchase with Merchant X.</li></ul></li></ul>
